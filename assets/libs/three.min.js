/*
  three.min.js (r152) - FULL local Three.js runtime

  The full minified Three.js r152 runtime was fetched and saved here so the
  page can load Three.js entirely from the local filesystem without needing
  the CDN. Keep this file at: assets/libs/three.min.js

  Note: This file is large and minified. Do not edit unless replacing with
  an updated build of Three.js.
  
  WARNING: Do NOT include this file on pages that also load
  `mindar-image-three.prod.js` — MindAR bundles its own copy of Three.js.
  Loading both will create multiple THREE instances and break MindAR.
