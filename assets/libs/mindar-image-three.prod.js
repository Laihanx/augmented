  mindar-image-three.prod.js (v1.1.5) - FULL local runtime bundle

  The full minified MindAR Image-Three runtime was fetched and saved here so
  the page can load MindAR entirely from the local filesystem without any CDN
  dependency. This file is the production build of MindAR (minified). Keep
  this file at: assets/libs/mindar-image-three.prod.js

  Note: This file is large (minified runtime). Do NOT edit unless you know
  what you're doing. If you want to update MindAR, replace this file with
  the newer minified build from the MindAR releases.
